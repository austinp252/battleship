# battleship

- show ships on DOM
- update ships on ship panel to right

- Multiple players
- Test cpu
- ship placement
- ship orientation
- aesthetics and sound effects
  - end game and prompts are not windows
- menu interface and restart from game

Consider for refactor: - initboard to clear

problem: how to pass ship and phase to the eventlistener on tile

- we can get coords by clicking on tile
- onclick only good for getting coords
